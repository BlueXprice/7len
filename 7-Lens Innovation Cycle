# 7-Lens Innovation Cycle

## Overview
My thinking framework, “7-Lens Innovation Cycle” or “7 C’s of Understanding”:

> Observe Actors → Qualify Traits → Model Mechanisms → Compose Prototype → Mine History → Validate Facts → Ground in Context

Mapped to:

> (1) Cast → (2) Characteristics → (3) Causality → (4) Composition → (5) Chronology → (6) Confirmation → (7) Context

Or in simpler terms:

> (1) Characters & Observation, (2) Characteristics, Analysis & Pattern, (3) System & Modeling, (4) Creation, Build, and Testing, (5) Historical Reflection, (6) Validation, (7) Contextual Grounding

## 7 Lenses Detailed

### 1. Characters / Elements
- Actor, People, Animal, Thing, Stuff, Substance, Object
- Inspiration, Tangible, Substitute, Problem, Resource, Material
- Population, Sample, Issue, Identity, Observation, Find Information, Place

### 2. 2-Dimensions (Traits/Attributes)
- Pattern, Shape, Emotional, Psychology, Behavior, Action
- Status, Feeling, Position, Habit, Decision, Color, Motivation
- Judgment, Size, Volume, Power Unit, Attribute, Role
- Temperature, Movement, Value, 5-Senses, Function, Difference
- Message, Communication, Text, Explanation, Belief, Evidence, Statistic
- Self-awareness, Goal, Target, Capability, Ability, Property, Feature, Marker, Attraction

### 3. 3-Dimensions of Processing (Causality)
- Interaction, Reaction, Mechanic, Effect, Logic, Theory
- Physics, Math, Philosophy, Strategy, Architecture, Design
- Mixing, Scientific, Reasons, Time, Principle, Law & Order, Mindset
- System, Structure, Construction, Formation, Algorithm
- Mental Model, Engine, Gravity, Puzzle, Pathway, Calculus, Algebra
- Force, Extraction, Rule, Law, Quantitative, Planning

### 4. Composing / Creation / Experiment
- Combine elements from 1-3 for computation
- Remove or isolate factors
- Prototype, Testing, Trial Ideas, Assumption, Hypothesis, Prediction
- Stress-testing, Purpose, Solution, Simulation
- Solve Complex Equations, Game Design, Evaluation, Review, Consultation
- New Belief, Debugging, Troubleshoot, Solve Problems
- Artificial Experience, Synthetic Thinking, Prototype Creation, Synthesis, Formulation, Metaphor, Interpretation

### 5. History / Research / Result
- Past events, records, analysis, reports, experiences
- Knowledge gained from mistakes, successes, stories
- Misunderstanding, Misconception, Current Belief

### 6. Fact / Proof Validation / New Invention
- Validation by including or excluding historical data
- Formation of new masterpiece
- Emphasis on Accuracy, Backtesting, Wisdom
- New research outcomes, nature insights, unseen results

### 7. Context / Current Environment
- Circumstances, Environments, Art, Fashion, Theme
- Lifestyle, Black Swan Events, Culture, Economic Background
- Landscape, Situation, Enclosure, Festival, Tradition, Trend, Schedule

## Interconnections
- 7th links to 1st and 6th
- 6th links to 4th, 5th, 7th (may skip 5th)
- 5th links to 4th, moving to 6th
- 4th connects with 3rd, re-processes 1st-3rd
- 3rd connects to 1st and 2nd (2nd sometimes skipped)
- 2nd connects back to 1st, then loops with 3rd
- 1st loops into 2nd and 7th
